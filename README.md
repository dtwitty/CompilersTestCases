==================

Sets of test cases for CS 4121


Please follow this format for test cases:

input: 
test_name.in

output:
test_name.out

Please try to give each test a descriptive name. 
If you are worried about race conditions, feel free to make your own subfolders.

TEST OUTPUTS SHOULD EXACTLY MATCH EXPECTED PROGRAM OUTPUT. NO NEWLINES.

Please raise issues if a test case is incorrect. That being said, please try very hard to ensure test case correctness.
